# SpotiFree

Do you have an iTunes library full of music, but you can't listen to it everywhere like Spotify or Apple Music? SpotiFree aims to tackle that exact issue by making your entire library available online, hosted from any computer that can run an Apache server. 

## Note
I keep the server side files for myself due to security concerns. If you really want them, feel free to email me.
